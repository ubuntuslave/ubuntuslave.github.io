abstract = {We present direct multichannel tracking, an algo-rithm for tracking the pose of a monocular camera using high-dimensional features in a direct image alignment framework. Instead of using a single grayscale channel and assuming intensity constancy as in existing approaches, we extract multichannel features at each pixel from each image and assume feature constancy among consecutive images. Features are more discrim-inative and robust to noise and image variations than intensities, enabling more accurate camera tracking. We use as the features conventional hand-crafted features such as SIFT and more recent features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We evaluate the performance of our algorithm against the baseline of the single-channel tracking algorithm using several public datasets.},
