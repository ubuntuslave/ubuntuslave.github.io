My Ph.D thesis dissertation included research in topics of computer vision applied to robotic sensing for navigation, mobile autonomous robots and omnidirectional vision sensors. I enjoy researching science, hacking technology, and programming in any language that gets the job done, but my preferences are Python, C and modern C++. I have participated in various international events, conferences, and competitions. For instance, in 2009, I was part of the CityALIEN team, which won the Design Competition during the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC), and then I led a new team in 2011. I interned at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) for a year (2016-2017) where I was able to collaborate with Dr. Yuichi Taguchi and Dr. Chen Feng on developing algorithms for SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and 3D reconstruction.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"8d0972dd4ff800cd6d19f264079261ef","permalink":"https://ubuntuslave.github.io/authors/carlos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/carlos/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently working as a Robotics Engineer at Piaggio Fast Forward (PFF), where we are building the future of personal mobile robots (gita).
